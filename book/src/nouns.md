Hkaltui has three noun starter particles. I guess these could be considered articles, but they do not convey definiteness at all and only convey that a noun is starting. These are:

* `la` - Concrete noun
* `le` - Proposition
* `li` - Property
* `lo` - Relationship

The particle used **must** match the definition of the verb it is used with. While it would be possible to use one particle as the verb itself makes it clear what argument is expected where, I prefer that the noun particles reinforce the predicate frame system. Using the wrong particle constitutes a grammatical error.

Focus, where relevant, defaults to the first place(s) left unfilled in a clause being turned into a noun by `li` or `lo`.
