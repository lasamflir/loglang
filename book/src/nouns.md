# THE article

Hkaltui has only one article, `lo`, which opens a noun and takes scope inflection. Unlike most articles, its sole purpose is to start a noun and it has no implication of definiteness or indefiniteness.

# Implied focus

When a noun is placed into a slot of a verb, the verb governs how many focus particles it has. This number of focus particles is **required**, there cannot be more or less. Since it'd be a pain to say all of those particles, there is a rule for inserting them when left unsaid: focus particles fill any unfilled slots in a verb from the subject, through object and indirect object. Note that this is not necessarily the first slot available in Hkaltui sentence structure, especially in VOIS clauses or sentences where inserting implied focus based on sentence structure would cause verb-terminated nouns to be patientives instead of agentives.

The fact that the focus particles, implied or otherwise, are mandatory means that it's only grammatical to add extra arguments to a noun up to the number of places its verb has, minus the required number of focus particles. If the number of focus particles is higher than the number of slots the noun's predicate has, it's ungrammatical. Certain particles may change the number of arguments that a verb has, making it compatible with a slot it wouldn't be otherwise. It is very unlikely that overtly saying focus particles will be necessary in most cases thanks to implied focus.
