# Default word order

Default word order in Hkaltui is:

`S V O I`

Where S is the subject, V is the verb, O is the object and I is the indirect object. However, like in Lojban, the subject may be skipped over by starting with the verb:

`V O I`

However, Hkaltui has *cyclic word order*. This means that the next argument to be filled is the next that hasn't yet been filled, no matter what order they've been filled in (potentially using the -y series tags). This means that word order continues with S after O and I:

`V O I S`

Because Hkaltui incorporates verb arity into its grammar, cyclic word order doesn't end up filling any places that a noun doesn't have:

* `V O S` (two arguments)
* `V S` (one argument)
* `qy I S O V` (three arguments, I skipped to at start, verb last)

The placement of the verb in a clause is free, but may have effects on auto-termination. In particular, some clauses are verb-terminated, which requires that the verb is last in a sentence.
