# Scope inflection types

Hkaltui has three different approaches to terminating a nested sentence or clause. These are inflected on the starting particle of that clause and allow for sentences to contain barely any terminators while allowing for things like linked nouns without the need for a BE equivalent.

## Default, verb termination

In a verb-terminated clause, the verb of the sentence acts as the terminator, enforcing a verb-last word order. This is not so useful for sentences, but is better inside nouns as it allows for a noun to be terminated right away if it doesn't have any linked nouns of its own.

## -m, saturation termination

This only auto-terminates when a verb has all of its arguments filled. The current place being filled is allowed to cycle back around to the start in order to allow for this.

## -n, non-looping termination

This is similar to saturation termination but does not allow for looping back around. This is useful if the S place does not need to be filled but the other places do, by putting the verb first.

# Other inflections

## -q, terminator

One of my biggest frustrations when learning Lojban was that terminators bear no resemblance to the thing that they terminate. Additionally, because each selma'o has only one terminator, you may need more than one terminator if you nest two structures together, even if they start with different particles.

In Hkaltui, you don't need to remember any terminators because suffixing -q on the starting particle forms its terminator.

## -x, focus

This is like `ce'u` or `ke'a` in Lojban. This is whatever the "focus" of a nested clause or property/relationship is. It turns the starting particle into the focus pronoun of the clause.
