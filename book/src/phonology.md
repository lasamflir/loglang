# Phonology overview
The phonology and phonotactics of this language are not its focus, and are being designed around the needs of the morphology, not the other way around. Sounds are chosen based on how easy they are to represent with the latin alphabet, and how easily I can pronounce them. Consonant clusters are particularly important to the language as they form the basis of the SSM.
