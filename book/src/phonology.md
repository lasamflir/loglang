# Phonology overview
The phonology and phonotactics of this language are not its focus, and are being designed around the needs of the morphology, not the other way around. Sounds are chosen based on how easy they are to represent with the latin alphabet, and how easily I can pronounce them. Consonant clusters are particularly important to the language as they form the basis of the SSM.

# Permitted starting clusters

There are three "blocks" of A group clusters (See [SSM](ssm.md) for more info). One block is any unvoiced fricative followed by a stop. Another group is any voiced fricative followed by a stop. The final group is any sound but the voiced fricatives and approximants followed by an approximant with exceptions *tl* and *dl*.

There are 42 clusters in total organised into these tables.

## First block
|  | f | h | s | c |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| p |fp |hp |sp |cp |
| t |ft |ht |st |ct |
| k |fk |hk |sk |ck |

## Second block
|  | v | w | z | j |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| b |vb |wb |zb |jb |
| d |vd |wd |zd |jd |
| g |vg |wg |zg |jg |

## Third block
| | p | t | k | b | d | g | f | h | s | c |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| l |pl |  |kl |bl |  |gl |fl |hl |sl |cl |

# Permitted middle clusters

Permitted middle clusters can be pretty much anything, but cannot start with r as this would create a word that is very difficult to pronounce with a non-rhotic accent. Middle clusters also cannot contain two of the same letter.

# Vowel pairs
There are six permissible vowel pairs. These are:

* ai
* au
* ei
* eu
* oi
* ui

# Vowel sequence
The *vowel sequence* is a pattern reused consistently in the language where families of words index a table in some way. You can think of each entry as corresponding to its number. This is really important when it comes to the language's approach to grammatical transparency. The vowel sequence is:

| Number | Vowel |
| ------ | ----- |
| 1      | a     |
| 2      | e     |
| 3      | i     |
| 4      | o     |
| 5      | u     |
| 6      | y     |
| 7      | ai    |
| 8      | au    |
| 9      | ei    |
| 10     | eu    |
| 11     | oi    |
| 12     | ui    |
