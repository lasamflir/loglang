# Assigning particle space

All particles of this language belong to the B or BN syllable groups. Polysyllabic particles are possible by chaining together H and V segments within a particle like so:

`pa'au,ui,o'i'o`

This is very unlikely to be of use in the language as I do not foresee this language having many particles (since one of its goals is grammatical minimalism). Ideally all particles will be monosyllabic to begin with with polysyllabic particles being a last resort if all of the monosyllabic particle space is filled.

Since one of this language's goals is grammatical transparency, it's my goal that every particle should tell you how it changes the grammar of a sentence. This may not be possible for all particles if there's many in unique particle groups (called selma'o in Lojban) but in order to try to achieve this, I need a very systematic approach to assigning particles.

Particles that take an entire verb phrase as their "input" are by far the most important to this language, and will be assigned a large portion of the particle space initially. As I build more of the language, I will reconsider the assignment of particle space.

Ideally, nasal suffix scope inflection will be a completely consistent rule in the language. This means that any other type of particle cannot have a nasal suffix on it. This limits particle space somewhat, but will hopefully not be an issue.

# The particle space

For now, everything above y can be scope inflected.

# Example particles

## mu

Sentence separator. Can be inflected for scope as it "takes" a whole verb phrase with arguments.

## mai

Verb separator, like cu and li in Lojban and Toki Pona respectively.

## la

Concrete noun.

# le

Proposition. Contains a whole sentence used as a noun.

# li

Property. (Uses scope inflection for focus)

# lo

Relationship. (Also uses scope inflection for focus)

# my, ny, qy

Subject, object and indirect object tags. Equivalent to FA in Lojban.
