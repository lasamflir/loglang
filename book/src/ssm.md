# SSM overview
The SSM needs to work entirely without stress or tone, allow for reasonably flexible root words and allow for marking of scope on particles and predicate class on roots.
# Allowed "syllable" structure
"Syllable" structure is given by:
`((C)C)C(V)V(HV)...(N)`
* C is bcdfghjklprstvwz
* V is aeiouy
* H is ',
* N is mnqx

There may be an arbitrary number of HV parts.
# Root words
Root words start with one of a selection of permitted *initial clusters*. Because these must be pronounced in isolation, they must be reasonably easy to say without the need to insert a helper vowel on the start.

They can then contain any syllables starting with a single consonant or a permitted *middle cluster*. Middle clusters cannot follow a nasal as they're not really clusters. As they can always lean on a preceding vowel, they can be practically anything that's not two identical consonants or an initial cluster.

The last syllable of a word must have a middle cluster.
`Initial(Anything as long as N is not followed by CC)(Middle)`
This structure doesn't allow you to know that the last word has ended before the next word begins. You always need the full context to know that a word hasn't ended. The starts and ends of words are never ambiguous when looking at a whole text.
