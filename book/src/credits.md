I am not working alone. I have many inspirations along with help from members of [this project's discord server](https://discord.gg/a5abBtxqys).

I am inspired by [Lojban](https://mw.lojban.org/index.php?title=Lojban&setlang=en-GB), [Toaq](http://toaq.net/), [Eberban](https://eberban.github.io/eberban/) and [Xextan](https://xextan.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page). All of these languages represent very different interpretations of what a logical language should be, and I am selecting my favourite features from all of them, on top of hopefully presenting some original ideas.
