# Frames

For now, my logical language copies Toaq's set of predicate frames. These are the different structures that predicates can have in the language, defining what can fill each of their argument slots. Toaq uses C for concrete (noun) slots, 0 for propositions and 1 for properties and 2 for relationships. Unlike in Toaq, these are directly encoded in root words using the first vowel:

|Frame|Vowel|
|-----|-----|
|C    |    a|
|CC   |    e|
|CCC  |    i|
|0    |    o|
|C0   |    u|
|CC0  |    y|
|1    |   ai|
|C1   |   au|
|CC1  |   ei|
|2    |   eu|
|C2   |   oi|
|CC2  |   ui|

These vowels follew the vowel sequence, starting with all concrete and increasing first in argument count before changing type of the final slot.

# Example root words

Definitions are written using S, O and I indicating subject, object and indirect object.

## hkaltui

S is a this language.

## cka
